## Project Background
PanKB is a comprehensive pangenome knowledge base containing rich datasets across genes, genomes, species and families. However, users currently can only access pre-built analyses through the web frontend, limiting the custom exploration access.   
        
To address this, we developed an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that exposes PanKB's live data to external AI clients. This enables:     
- **Flexible data access**: Users can connect their own MCP-compatible clients (Claude Desktop, ChatGPT, etc.) or use our hosted Streamlit interface on PanKB website.   
- **Natural language interaction**: With LLM assistance, users can query and analyze pangenomic data through plain language.     
- **Real-time results**: Direct connection to PanKB database ensures up-to-date information.

## Roadmap

- [x] initialize codebase, use uv for env control, follow microservice structure to separate server and client apps into two directories, but track them using one repo 
- [x] write tools based on research papers, design tool categories
- [ ] reuse previous RAG and add to tools
- [ ] design and write resources (optional)
- [ ] design and write prompts 
- [x] write server app using FastMCP and uvicorn (to enable hot-reload for development), mount all server-side components
- [x] write client app, initiate client instance, import openai llm, write interaction loop between user, client, server and llm
- [x] write streamlit app, create session state to display conversation history, design welcome messages to guide usage
- [x] write dockerfiles to containerize server and client, write docker-compose to orchestrate
- [x] add logs for both server and client apps
- [x] add CI/CD workflows and use self-hosted runner
- [ ] design authorization methods, user-client (third-party OAuth), server-client
- [ ] design a panel on the streamlit front page to display past conversations and available tools, resources and prompts 
- [ ] build a SQL database to store user info, token usage and past conversations 
- [ ] apply for a certificate from Let's Encrypt and use nginx for reverse proxy, connect to prod server and publish to MCP server registry
- [ ] add export function for PNG/SVG and CSV
- [ ] set up a monitoring and alerting system (Grafana)
